# telescope-ros.nvim

ROS(2) package selector for [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) using colcon.

![Previe image](preview.gif)

The picker lets you select a ros package from your workspace and then subsequently starts a `find_file` operation in that package, somewhat similar to how `colcon edit` and `rosed` are used.

## Installation

Install the plugin and requirements

```
" Telescope requirements
Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
" Telescope
Plug 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
" This plugin
Plug 'bi0ha2ard/telescope-ros.nvim'
```

After the telescope setup, load the plugin with
```
lua require('telescope').load_extension('ros')
```

## Usage

Telescope integrates the extension into the `:Telescope` command, and you can start the picker with
```
:Telescope ros packages
```
which will show the packages from nvim's cwd.

You can also run the picker directly from lua:
```vim
:lua require'telescope'.extensions.ros.packages{}

```

If you want to overwrite the directory in which colcon looks for packages, you can overwrite the cwd:
```vim
" Directly specify a path
nnoremap <silent> <leader>dr :lua require'telescope'.extensions.ros.packages{cwd="<path to your WS root"}

" Or from an environment variable that you set previously
:lua require'telescope'.extensions.ros.packages{cwd=os.getenv("ROS_WORKSPACE") or "."}

```

## Convenience pickers
These require `neovim/nvim-lspconfig` for root pattern detection

- `files` runs a `find_files` in the package root of the file in the current buffer
- `grep_string` runs a `grep_string` in the package root of the file in the current buffer
- `live_grep` runs a `live_grep` in the package root of the file in the current buffer
